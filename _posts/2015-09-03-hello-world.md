I have always wanted to write a blog but it didn't materialise till now. Many people recommened this as a good practice because: 

1. A lot of thoughts go undocumented otherwise.
2. Others may also comment on what you write thus helping you broaden your viewpoint.

While I am certain about the first point, will anyone ever read whatever I write here? Probably yes, if I push it in their face in person :O or maybe if I write well or maybe just because people like reading stuff? I don't know. I don't even know what should I write about, maybe something related to tech, or something that I found hillarious? This is the first time that my writings will be in public. Be kind people! If we consider that I was struggling with how this post should begin just 5 minutes ago, I think I'll do just fine.

They wonder how the snowplough driver gets to work, or how the makers of dictionaries look up the spelling of words. <br> <span style = "float: right; margin: auto">-- Terry Pratchett, Hogfather</span> <br>

Now that I am done wondering how to start, lets see if this gains some traction or just lies low unknown in the void that the Internet is.

Please tell me if you liked the posts or not. Do mention your name and/or email as well.
