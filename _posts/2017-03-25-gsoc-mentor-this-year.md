I will be mentoring students in Google Summer of Code this year for two organizations:

1. [CloudCV](https://cloudcv.org/) - project: [Origami](https://github.com/Cloud-CV/cvfy-frontend).
2. [Chapel](http://chapel.cray.com/) - project: Chapel Online IDE (fresh start).

Time to take a look at things from the other side of the table. Looking forward to a fruitful summer! :D
