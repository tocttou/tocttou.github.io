[Unmaintained]

Recently Github updated their UI for the worse. As a part of this update they removed the account creation date on profile pages. Luckily, they still give out this information in an unauthenticated API. I hacked together a small WebExtension to display that date where it used to be before.

Sideload for firefox.
