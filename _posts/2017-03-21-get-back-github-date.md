Recently Github updated their UI for the worse. As a part of this update they removed the account creation date on profile pages (this happened a couple of weeks before the recent stylesheet updates). I often used that as a metric to know more about a person by comparing the kind of work they have put up on Github with the time they have spent on the platform. For new developers it is roughly equal to the time they have spent in software development industry. Luckily, they still give out this information in an unauthenticated API. I hacked together a small chrome extension to display that date where it used to be before.
