title: First Lecture Delivered

A couple of weeks ago I delivered a hands-on lecture on python basics to freshmen in SDSLabs. This lecture was a part of the lecture series we have here to get people up and running with essential tech. This was the first time I delivered a lecture and it wasn't as hard as I was expecting it to be, more so because the audience was uninitiated (but brilliant) with python. They did ask a couple of questions which I wasn't sure of but nothing that a quick trial with the python repl couldn't answer. The lecture was a bit long so people started yawning after 4 hours (yeah right when the important bits came). It should have been in two parts. Preparing the presentation helped me consolidate what I had learned about python all through the last year.

The variant of choice here was python3. An important topic of handling exceptions was left because of the time constraint I had while preparing the slides. I _might_ add those portions in the coming days. The lecture was followed by two assignments. Here are the slides:
