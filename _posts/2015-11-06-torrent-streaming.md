title: Making my own torrent streaming service

Few weeks back Microsoft came to my college for the annual [Code.Fun.Do](https://www.acadaccelerator.com/Home/Events) hackathon. I was planning to make an app that extracted text from photographs taken by the phone camera and then does *something*. The idea had a lot of potential but initial tests were not very successful, primarily because text extraction was messed up nearly 8/10 times. So I decided to make an app that can be used to watch movies from torrents on mobile phone.

Microsoft guys were very excited to see it work but of course they can't be supportive of it.
