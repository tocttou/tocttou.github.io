Its 5:30 AM and I am watching a presentation on [Reactive Programming at Netflix](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uODxUJ5Jwis), and now I am writing this blogpost (on a sidenote, subscribe to [Netflix UI Engineering](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCGGRRqAjPm6sL3-WGBDnKJA/), [Google Chrome Developers](https://www.youtube.com/user/ChromeDevelopers) and [Facebook Developers](https://www.youtube.com/user/FacebookDevelopers) - they post great content! Go watch all the React Conf 2017 videos). At [00:50](https://youtu.be/uODxUJ5Jwis?t=50s) mark the speaker mentions that he watches Netflix every night before he goes to bed. As normal as it is, this puzzled me a lot because I stuggle to do this myself, despite having all the free time in the world. The __transition__ between Work and Life just never happens. That doesn't mean that I am working all the time, but rather that I find myself in a limbo between the two states. I don't remember the last time I went to sleep by my own. I just keep doing whatever I am doing and let the sleep engulf me subconsciously. I only sleep when I get so tired that I can't keep my eyes open (¯\\_(ツ)_/¯). I rarely watch movies in one go. There is always something else that requires my attention -  checking HackerNews, checking email, new reddit shitpost, some dank meme, new youtube video by CarryMinati, friends asking me to join them in CS:GO, new course on Pluralsight, new comment on Github issues. I hate it so much. 

This also reflects in how I tend to work. I just can't stop working until the damn thing is done even if it takes 30 hours or more. Sometimes I decide to skip all the meals in between too. But when I stop working, I just can't go back to work for days on stretch. I realize that this is incredibly stupid and affects my problem solving ability once a threshold of 12 hours is passed, but that is how it is. I am too afraid of leaving the __zone__ because entering the zone requires leaving the comfort zone. Same reason I absolutely hate days on which I have a 1 hour class only. I just can't get myself to start working on something new that day because I know that I'll have to leave the zone in between and so the day is just ruined!

Maintaining a good work-life balance requires the ability to demarcate various aspects on one's life distinctly. I seem to have lost that ability because of unrestricted living for the last few years. Would be interesting to see how it turns out in the next few years.
